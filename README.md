Updated version of Shell project to incorportate memory management.

As of submission, could only get the following commands to
work succesfully.

To run use Make program then executable named program

memload <filename>
memview
memset <value>
memalg <algorithm>
memreset

memload is having issues with instructor test file, but copying values into a personal test file by hand, test.txt
memload works just fine. Weird invisible character issue.

Memstep currently works for all 3 algorithms.

Memrun has not been implemented.
